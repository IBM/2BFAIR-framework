          <li id="maturity">
            <strong>Maturity:</strong> The maturity levels correspond to a
            simplified scoring system to indicate the FAIR compliance of a
            <a href="glossary#digital-object">Digital Object</a>. 2BFAIR follows
            the levels defined by F-UJI,which were inspired by the FAIRsFAIR CMMI-based
            three tiers. 
            The F-UJI maturity levels are incomplete (0), initial (1), moderate (2), and advanced (3). 
            For 2BFAIR, the maturity levels are defined as follow:
            <ol class="inner-list" style="list-style-type: decimal" start="0">
              <li>
                <strong>Incomplete:</strong> The

                address the
                <a href="glossary#FAIR-principles">FAIR Principles</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Initial:</strong> Some initial characteristics are
                handled toward FAIR although they do not meet the
                <a href="glossary#principle">Principles</a>' definitions. There
                is intent to be compliant with FAIR principles and awareness of
                existing issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Moderate:</strong> Limited FAIR characteristics are
                handled and there is focus toward full alignment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Advanced:</strong> Complete coverage of the FAIR
                <a href="glossary#principle">Principles</a>' characteristics
                aligned with organizational standards and practice.

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li id="maturity-computation">
            <strong>Maturity Computation:</strong> The maturity level is
            calculated for principle as follows. In case of at least one metric
            has reached level 'initial', the corresponding principle cannot have
            a lower level even if all other metrics are scored lower. All levels
            above 'initial' are calculated as the rounded mean of all metrics
            scores for a given principle. The overall F-UJI FAIR level for a
            given research data object would analogously be calculated as a
            rounded mean of all principle scores.
          </li>
          <li id="scoring-mechanism">
            <strong>Scoring Mechanism:</strong> The scoring mechanism defines
            how to compute the <a href="glossary#metric">Metric</a>'s score.
            There are two types of computation: Alternative or Cumulative. In
            the alternative computation,
            <a href="glossary#test">Test</a> results are considered
            independently, i.e., only one of the metric’s test can pass. The
            metric’s score then reflects the score of the test that passed. In
            the cumulative computation, the metric’s score is the total of the
            scores of all tests that passed.

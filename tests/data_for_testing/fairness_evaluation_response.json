Provenance data (also known as lineage) represents a dataset's history, including the people, entities, and processes involved in its creation, management and longer-term curation. It is essential that data producers provide provenance information about the data to enable informed use and reuse. The levels of provenance information needed can vary depending on the data type (e.g., measurement, observation, derived data, or data product) and research domains. We suggest to include provenance properties related to: (i) Sources of data, e.g., datasets the data is derived from and instruments; (ii) Data creation or collection date; (iii) Contributors involved in data creation and their roles; and (iv) Data publication, modification and versioning information. There are various ways through which provenance information may be included in a metadata record (Devaraju et al., 2022).",

        "description": "An 8,000-year lacustrine sediment record from Lake Motosu (Fuji Five Lakes) records several eruptions, including potentially unreported events, of the active Mt. Fuji volcano, which receives approximately 47 million annual visitors. A high-fidelity age model is constructed from tephra ages and high-density radiocarbon dating of terrestrial macrofossil and bulk organic matter. Variability in lake reservoir age is constrained by modern lake water radiocarbon measurement and reverse calibration of tephra calendar ages. We present more accurate ages for known eruptions, detect a wider distribution of ejecta for the most recent summit eruption, and potentially identify previously undetected flank eruptions. There are closely spaced scoria-fall layers that may be difficult to differentiate as separate events in land-based surveys. These results demonstrate the utility of lacustrine sediments as powerful tools for understanding characteristics of volcanic eruptions.",
        "abstract": "An 8,000-year lacustrine sediment record from Lake Motosu (Fuji Five Lakes) records several eruptions, including potentially unreported events, of the active Mt. Fuji volcano, which receives approximately 47 million annual visitors. A high-fidelity age model is constructed from tephra ages and high-density radiocarbon dating of terrestrial macrofossil and bulk organic matter. Variability in lake reservoir age is constrained by modern lake water radiocarbon measurement and reverse calibration of tephra calendar ages. We present more accurate ages for known eruptions, detect a wider distribution of ejecta for the most recent summit eruption, and potentially identify previously undetected flank eruptions. There are closely spaced scoria-fall layers that may be difficult to differentiate as separate events in land-based surveys. These results demonstrate the utility of lacustrine sediments as powerful tools for understanding characteristics of volcanic eruptions.",

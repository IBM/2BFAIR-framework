The levels of provenance information needed can vary depending on the data type (e.g., measurement, observation, derived data, or data product) and research domains. We suggest including provenance properties related to: (i) Sources of data, e.g., datasets the data is derived from and instruments; (ii) Data creation or collection date; (iii) Contributors involved in data creation and their roles; and (iv) Data publication, modification and versioning information.
